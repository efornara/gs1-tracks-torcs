License: Free-Art-License
 Preamble
 .
 The Free Art License grants the right to freely copy, distribute, and
 transform creative works without infringing the author’s rights.
 .
 The Free Art License recognizes and protects these rights. Their
 implementation has been reformulated in order to allow everyone to use
 creations of the human mind in a creative manner, regardless of their types
 and ways of  expression.
 .
 While the public’s access to creations of the human mind usually is restricted
 by the implementation of copyright law, it is favoured by the Free Art License.
 This license intends to allow the use of a work’s resources; to establish new
 conditions for creating in order to increase creation opportunities. The Free
 Art License grants the right to use a work, and acknowledges the right holder’s
 and the user’s rights and responsibility.
 .
 The invention and development of digital technologies, Internet and Free
 Software have changed creation methods: creations of the human mind can
 obviously be distributed, exchanged, and transformed. They allow to produce
 common works to which everyone can contribute to the benefit of all.
 .
 The main rationale for this Free Art License is to promote and protect these
 creations of the human mind according to the principles of copyleft: freedom
 to use, copy, distribute, transform, and prohibition of exclusive
 appropriation.
 .
 Definitions
 .
 « work » either means the initial work, the subsequent works or the common work as defined hereafter:
 .
 « common work » means a work composed of the initial work and all subsequent
 contributions to it (originals and copies). The initial author is the one who,
 by choosing this license, defines the conditions under which contributions are
 made.
 .
 « Initial work » means the work created by the initiator of the common work
 (as defined above), the copies of which can be modified by whoever wants to
 .
 « Subsequent works » means the contributions made by authors who participate in
 the evolution of the common work by exercising the rights to reproduce,
 distribute, and modify that are granted by the license.
 .
 « Originals » (sources or resources of the work) means all copies of either the
 initial work or any subsequent work mentioning a date and used by their
 author(s) as references for any subsequent updates, interpretations, copies or
 reproductions.
 .
 « Copy » means any reproduction of an original as defined by this license.
 .
 1. OBJECT
 The aim of this license is to define the conditions under which one can use this work freely.
 .
 2. SCOPE
 This work is subject to copyright law. Through this license its author
 specifies the extent to which you can copy, distribute, and modify it.
 .
 2.1 FREEDOM TO COPY (OR TO MAKE REPRODUCTIONS)
 You have the right to copy this work for yourself, your friends or any other person, whatever the technique used.
 .
 2.2 FREEDOM TO DISTRIBUTE, TO PERFORM IN PUBLIC
 You have the right to distribute copies of this work; whether modified or not,
 whatever the medium and the place, with or without any charge, provided that
 you: attach this license without any modification to the copies of this work
 or indicate precisely where the license can be found, specify to the recipient
 the names of the author(s) of the originals, including yours if you have
 modified the work, specify to the recipient where to access the originals
 (either initial or subsequent).  The authors of the originals may, if they
 wish to, give you the right to distribute the originals under the same
 conditions as the copies.
 .
 2.3 FREEDOM TO MODIFY
 You have the right to modify copies of the originals (whether initial or
 subsequent) provided you comply with the following conditions: all conditions
 in article 2.2 above, if you distribute modified copies; indicate that the
 work has been modified and, if it is possible, what kind of modifications have
 been made; distribute the subsequent work under the same license or any
 compatible license.  The author(s) of the original work may give you the right
 to modify it under the same conditions as the copies.
 .
 3. RELATED RIGHTS
 Activities giving rise to author’s rights and related rights shall not
 challenge the rights granted by this license.  For example, this is the reason
 why performances must be subject to the same license or a compatible license.
 Similarly, integrating the work in a database, a compilation or an anthology
 shall not prevent anyone from using the work under the same conditions as those
 defined in this license.
 .
 4. INCORPORATION OF THE WORK
 Incorporating this work into a larger work that is not subject to the Free Art
 License shall not challenge the rights granted by this license.  If the work
 can no longer be accessed apart from the larger work in which it is
 incorporated, then incorporation shall only be allowed under the condition
 that the larger work is subject either to the Free Art License or a compatible
 license.
 .
 5. COMPATIBILITY
 A license is compatible with the Free Art License provided: it gives the right
 to copy, distribute, and modify copies of the work including for commercial
 purposes and without any other restrictions than those required by the respect
 of the other compatibility criteria; it ensures proper attribution of the work
 to its authors and access to previous versions of the work when possible; it
 recognizes the Free Art License as compatible (reciprocity); it requires that
 changes made to the work be subject to the same license or to a license which
 also meets these compatibility criteria.
 .
 6. YOUR INTELLECTUAL RIGHTS
 This license does not aim at denying your author’s rights in your contribution
 or any related right. By choosing to contribute to the development of this
 common work, you only agree to grant others the same rights with regard to
 your contribution as those you were granted by this license. Conferring these
 rights does not mean you have to give up your intellectual rights.
 .
 7. YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES
 The freedom to use the work as defined by the Free Art License (right to copy,
 distribute, modify) implies that everyone is responsible for their own actions.
 .
 8. DURATION OF THE LICENSE
 This license takes effect as of your acceptance of its terms. The act of
 copying, distributing, or modifying the work constitutes a tacit agreement.
 This license will remain in effect for as long as the copyright which is
 attached to the work. If you do not respect the terms of this license, you
 automatically lose the rights that it confers.  If the legal status or
 legislation to which you are subject makes it impossible for you to respect the
 terms of this license, you may not make use of the rights which it confers.
 .
 9. VARIOUS VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE
 This license may undergo periodic modifications to incorporate improvements by
 its authors (instigators of the « Copyleft Attitude »movement) by way of new,
 numbered versions.  You will always have the choice of accepting the terms
 contained in the version under which the copy of the work was distributed to
 you, or alternatively, to use the provisions of one of the subsequent
 versions.
 .
 10. SUB-LICENSING
 Sub-licenses are not authorized by this license. Any person wishing to make use
 of the rights that it confers will be directly bound to the authors of the
 common work.
 .
 11. LEGAL FRAMEWORK
 This license is written with respect to both French law and the Berne
 Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.
